# SymbioBots: Self-Sustaining Green Colonies  
> Robots that grow forests while humans sleep 🤖💚  

---

## The Big Idea  
Urbanization, deforestation, and climate change are destroying green cover.  
**SymbioBots** is a self-sustaining ecosystem of **Seed-Swarm Drones**, **Guardian Ground-Bots**, and **Bio-Hubs** that autonomously plant, monitor, and maintain greenery — creating **robotic forests that care for themselves.**

This project connects **Mechanical Engineering, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence** to design autonomous machines that restore urban and forest ecosystems.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

### 1️⃣ Seed-Swarm Drones 🚁  
- Plant biodegradable seed capsules with nutrients and fungi.  
- Use AI to identify optimal planting zones based on soil and light data.  

### 2️⃣ Guardian Ground-Bots 🤖  
- Aerate soil, remove weeds, water plants, and clean litter.  
- Recharge using solar panels or at nearby Bio-Hubs.  

### 3️⃣ Bio-Hubs 🌐  
- Collect rainwater and purify greywater.  
- Redistribute resources to drones and bots.  
- Track biodiversity and CO₂ absorption.  

### 4️⃣ Data Dashboard 💻  
- Real-time monitoring of plant growth, air quality, and carbon capture.  
- AI analytics predict ecosystem health and suggest actions.

## 🌍 Impact  

| Area | Benefit |
|------|----------|
| **Urban** | Converts rooftops and sidewalks into green corridors. |
| **Rural** | Restores degraded forest areas post-disaster. |
| **Climate** | Provides carbon sequestration data for governments/NGOs. |

> “Not just planting trees — creating self-sustaining robotic forests.” 🌳

## 🧠 Future Vision  
- **AI ecosystem learning:** Bots adapt to local climates and soil conditions.  
- **Self-repairing robots:** Use biodegradable materials for small repairs.  
- **Swarm intelligence:** Cooperative drone and bot coordination.  
- **Disaster resilience:** Auto-restoration after fires or floods.

## 💡 Motivation  
The world is losing forests faster than we can plant them.  
SymbioBots is my vision of a future where **technology and nature coexist** — using engineering to help the planet heal itself.

## 🧪 Prototype & Demo Ideas  
You don’t need full-scale robots to demonstrate the concept!  
Possible demo components:  
- A **mini ground bot** (Arduino or Raspberry Pi) simulating watering or planting.  
- A **Python simulation** of drone–bot–hub communication.  
- A **dashboard mockup** tracking CO₂ absorption or greenery growth.
